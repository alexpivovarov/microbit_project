# Safety and Use Limitations

This project is a prototype for educational and experimentation purposes only. It is not a medical device.

## Do not use for real care
- Do not rely on this system for emergency response or elderly care.
- False negatives and false positives are possible.
- The radio link is not guaranteed to deliver messages.

## Human testing
- Test with caution and avoid any action that could cause harm.
- Do not simulate falls with real people.
- Prefer lab-style testing with devices attached to a dummy rig.

## Data and privacy
- The system broadcasts data over unencrypted radio.
- Do not include sensitive or identifying data in payloads.

## Regulatory compliance
- Medical and safety systems require certification and regulatory review.
- Consult local regulations if you plan to evolve this into a real product.
